# Reaching the Internet

Now that we have an understanding of all the physical hardware required for a network to exist, let's look at the software level.

We will briefly look at the following concepts:

- DHCP Servers
- Public vs Private IP addresses
- DNS (Domain name system)

## DHCP Server

A DHCP server (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is responsible for managing the distribution of IP addresses in a network.

The IPs of a network can be assigned in two different ways: **Static IP** 


Static IP Address Assignment

-   IP address never changes.
    
-   Assigned by network administrator or ISP.
    

  

Dynamic IP Address Assignment

-   IP address is temporary.
    
-   Assigned from pool of available addresses. 
    

-   Reduces time and planning for IP address management.
    
-   Reduce potential for conflict in assigning IP addresses.

All network have a DHCP server


We will cover these topics by understanding what is required for a web browser to successfully request a website from a web server.
