# Intro to Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are a way of storing and processing data in a table format.

There are many examples of spreadsheet software such as:

- Microsoft **Excel**
- Google **Sheets**
- Apple **Numbers**s
- LibreOffice **Calc**

## New or need a refresher?

A spreadsheet can have one or more sheet. Each sheet contains **multiple cells** and all the cells are **organized in columns and rows**.

In this course we will focus on using Excel, however, 90% of the functionality we will use is also available in Google Sheets.

## Content & Cell width

In certain cases, **if the cell's width is narrower than it's contents**, you might see repeated "#" characters.

To properly display the cell contents, simply make the cells wider.
