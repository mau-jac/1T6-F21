## Be careful with Auto-sorting ‚ö†

> Be careful when sorting data and make sure that related fields are moving along with the data being sorted.    



In the animation below, notice how the selected range is the only  thing being sorted. The neighbouring data that is related to those cells are not being sorted.

This happens because there are two types of sorting:

### Sort sheet

Sort sheet organizes all the data according to one column. **The rows move together.**

To use a sort sheet select a cell in the column you want to sort.

### Sort range

Sort range organizes the data in a specified range of cells. **Only the cells in the specified range get arranged.**

To use a sort range select a range you want to sort.
