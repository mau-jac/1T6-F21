# Abstraction & Asking for Help

Learning when and how to ask for help is an extremely important skill that all developers need to learn.

Every programmer will eventually run into roadblocks and **learning to ask for help is as important as learning to debug.** 

## Abstractions

One of the reasons why developers are guaranteed to need help is the fact that computer science is build on layers of abstractions and we cannot possibly understand all the layers.

An [abstraction](https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Abstraction) is a simplified but functional model of a lower more complex layer.

> In other words, we can use this simplified model (the abstraction) to get things done without understanding the details of the layer just below.

For example, to write an algorithm in C# we don't need to know the details of how C# is being compiled to assembly language. It is sufficient to just understand how to use C#.

</p>

Similarly, we've learned binary information is stored in transistors to eventually make up text and programs. However, on a daily basis we don't need to think about how that is happening. We can simply focus on the text we are trying to write.

Occasionally, when trying to grow our understanding of any given abstraction layer, we will run into it's limitations and the simplified model will no longer be sufficient. It can take some time for you to even realize that the problem is the limitation of the abstraction that you are dealing with.

In an ideal scenario, you would take time to learn about the details of the abstraction layer just below. However, if this happens at work and you are on a timeline, you will need to ask for help.

## Help

### When to Ask for Help

Not knowing when to ask for help is a common problem for developers of all skill levels:

- **The desire to problem solve**: programmers are natural problem solvers.
- **Pride**: trying to prove skills.

Asking for help **at the right moments** will:

- Speed up your learning
- Save you from lots of frustration
- Allow you to benefit from collective intelligence

<br>

### Before Asking for Help

1. **Reproduce the problem**

   1. Whoever helps you will need to see the problem reproduced.
      1. Help them help you.
   2. Reproducing it often gives you new insights.

2. **Isolate the problem**

   1. Can you roughly identify where the problem is coming from ?

3. **Try to understand the error**

   1. Take a moment to **read the full error message**.
   2. Not all error messages are the same.
   3. A human chose to display that message for a reason. Do your best to extract useful information from it.

4. **Do some research**

   1. **Read the course notes! üôè**
   2. Check the manual (official documentation)
   3. You are most likely not the first person to have this problem. Others might have written about it
   4. Be careful with internet‚Äôs habit-holes!

<br>

### When asking for help

1. **State what you know**

   1. This forces you to reflect about what you know
   2. You are more likely to get an answer that is at your level.

   

2. **Guess what the answer might be**

   1. Shows that you've put some effort in figuring it out.
   2. Indicated the kind of answer you are looking for.

   

3. **State what you have tried to fix the problem.**

   1. Shows your level of understanding of the issue.
   2. Helps the person answering know where to start.
