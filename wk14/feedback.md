# Working in Teams

Working effectively in teams is generally considered to be a self acquired ability and workplaces typically offer very little support on developing this skill set.

> Like most other skills, learning to be productive and effective in teams can be learnt through training and practice.

This short chapter focuses on receiving and giving feedback which is an essential part of learning in team environments.



## Conflict vs Feedback

Humans generally tend to avoid conflict at all costs. However, individuals are unique and complex and conflict is a normal and natural aspect of human relations.

**What determines if a conflict is good or bad is how we dealt with it, not the fact that conflict emerged in first place.**

<br>

Conflict resolution is a well studied and documented process, however, it's beyond the scope of this course. Instead we will focus on preventing conflict and maximizing learning through feedback.



> Learning to give and receive feedback is an important communication skill that help teams:
>
> - Deal with frictions before they escalate into conflict;
> - Create an environment that encourages peer-to-peer learning;



## Giving  Feedback

#### Before you start 🚦

- **Be honest but remember that feedback is merely your opinion.**
- Constructive feedback is about believing in the person's growth (if they want to) rather than weakness.
- Give feedback in private. **Ask if listener is open to receiving feedback.**



#### Be specific 🎯

- Avoid general comments that won't help identify the specific behaviour being addressed.

- Include examples of specific situations when you observed the behaviour.

  Example:

    - "At the end of the last team meeting you interrupted me several times and wouldn't let me finish my progress updates."
        - Instead of: "You always interrupt people and only care about your contributions."

  

#### Focus on the behaviour, not the person 🚫👉

- Avoid being accusatory. The receiver is more likely to stay open and listen.

  Examples:

  - "I felt offended by your comment and I suspect others might feel similarly"

    - Instead of: "You've just offended every person in this group".

  - "How did that comment make you feel? You looked upset."
    - Instead of: "Don't you think you over-reacted to that comment?"

      

- Speak from the "I" pronoun:

  - Explain how you observe the behaviour and the impact  it has on you.
  - Makes it more specific and concrete.
  - Does not imply that your opinion is universally agreed on.

  Example:

  - “I haven’t seen you in class in for a week. I’m worried that you are  missing important information. Can we meet soon to discuss it?”
  
    - Instead of: “You obviously don’t care about this course!”
  
    

#### Balance the content: "Make a sandwich" 🥪

<br>

- Start and end your feedback with strengths.
- Helps put things in perspective and distinguish what's working vs not working.
- Person is more likely to listen.



#### Involve the receiver 💬❔

- Treat the receiver as an equal. We all have blind-spots.
- Ask if any points need clarification.
- Ask about the receiver's thoughts or feelings on the feedback given.

In the TED talk below, cognitive psychologist LeeAnn Renniger shares the findings from her research where she points out 4 steps to giving great feedback.

## Receiving Feedback

#### Is this the right time? 😤

- Assess your intellectual and emotional state.
- Can you listen without getting defensive? (aka. toning down the ego a few notches)
- Let the feedback giver know if now is not the time.

- If not the right time, be proactive about finding another moment.

  

#### Listen first 👂

- Don't interrupt.
- Focus on absorbing information rather than anticipating or assuming what is being said.
- Stay open to new ideas and different opinions.
- Have a growth or learning attitude about it.



#### Confirm understanding ✔

- Ask for clarifications if necessary.
- Summarize main points back to the feedback giver.
- If the feedback style was unhelpful, explain the type of feedback you would need.



#### Reflect and decide what to do 🤔

- Take some time to reflect, you don't need to reply right the way.
- If you disagree with the feedback, consider asking for a second opinion from someone else.
- Decide what you want to do with the information you just received.
